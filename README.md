Summary of what this project is about

1. **Database Creation:**
   - I started by creating a PostgreSQL database named "Project."

2. **Importing Data into Database:**
   - I imported data from a CSV file into the "Project" database using tools like pgAdmin.
   - I encountered and resolved issues related to data import, such as column types and delimiter settings.

3. **Data Filtering:**
   - I explored SQL queries to filter and retrieve specific data from the database.
   - I also worked on refining queries, including filtering by year and country.

4. **Integration with Hadoop Hive:**
   - I discussed the possibility of connecting the PostgreSQL database to Hadoop Hive.

5. **Hadoop Environment Integration:**
   - While I discussed the idea of integrating the database with Hadoop, I did not perform specific steps for this integration.

6. **Exporting Data:**
   - I learned how to export data from PostgreSQL to a CSV file.
   - I discussed the options available in pgAdmin for exporting data.

7. **Troubleshooting and Issue Resolution:**
   - I addressed various issues, such as data import errors, SQL query errors, and backup creation issues.
   - I provided solutions to overcome these challenges.

8. **Backup Creation:**
   - I demonstrated how to create a backup of the PostgreSQL database using the `pg_dump` command.

9. **Environment Configuration:**
   - I discussed setting environment variables and paths to enable the use of PostgreSQL commands in the Command Prompt.

Throughout these tasks, I worked on database management, data manipulation, SQL queries, and backup creation within a PostgreSQL environment. Please let me know if you have any more specific questions or if there are additional tasks you'd like assistance with.
